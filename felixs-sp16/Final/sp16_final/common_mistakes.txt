Common Mistakes
 
1.3
 
- Not saying that Pr[X−100p>50−100p]≤Pr[|X−100p|>50−100p] explicitly means you were only eligible for 3 points.
- No credit for applying Chebyshev's inequality if you divided the probability by 2
 
1.4
 
Mostly people made mistakes on the variance, or didn't know how to apply CLT so well. See the rubric.
 
2.1
 
Many people are just writing out expressions for cov(x, y), cov(y, z), cov(x,z) without giving explanations and/or counterexamples. The best way to prove something is false is provide a counterexample!
 
Writing True => 0 Points
Writing False w/o Justification => 1 Point
Writing False w/ somewhat right direction justification => 2 points
Writing False w/ fully correct Justification => 3 Points
 
2.2
 
-> Saying it's always 3.5.
 
2.5
 
People are just assuming that since there is an invariant distribution that the probabilities will converge, but you need to recognize that the chain is aperiodic to guarantee convergence.
 
3.3
 
- Only the first rubric item was awarded for two-state or three-state Markov diagrams that did not have enough states to represent the problem
- The first and second rubric items were awarded to those who had correct Markov diagrams, but did not write down the correct first step equations
- If you wrote down the correct first step equations but made an arithmetic error while solving for the expectation, please submit a regrade request to obtain the third rubric item
- If you concluded that the expected number of flips was 8, and half of them are expected to be tails, please submit a regrade request (we will award you 6 points)
- Please keep in mind that the first step equations for this problem were not the same as the examples given previously in lectures
 
3.1
 
- No partial credit awarded for these problems
- Please do not submit any regrade requests for this problem unless you are certain that you have the correct answer and we did not give you points
- In the future, please do not try writing E(Y|X) as a formula when you don't need to
 
3.4

Part (a)
- Full credit answers: E(Xn+1|Xn)=(1−α−β)Xn+Nα
- I took off 0.5 points for the following answers: α(N−Xn)+βXn, or replacing Xn with E(Xn). Other similar answers will not be considered for partial credit.

Part (b)
- 0.5 partial credit points were awarded for writing down E(Xn+1)=E(E(Xn+1|Xn))
- 2 points were awarded by writing down E(Xn+1) as a function of E(Xn) in a manner that was consistent with part (a) (Note that simply writing down equations for E(X1), E(X2), and E(X3) were not sufficient! I was specifically looking for the use of the law of total expectation.)
- 1 point was awarded for correctly solving the recurrence relation (either by writing down a summation formula for E(Xn) or by finding the closed form solution)
- 0.5 points were taken off for mistakes, such as writing E(X1)=N, or "off by one" errors in the summation indices

Part (c)
- 1 point was awarded for drawing a Markov chain diagram, or writing transition probabilities (simply writing down π was not sufficient)
- Full credit was awarded for correctly writing down the probability of a binomial distribution with parameters N and p=α/(α+β) (No one got this one correct)
 
3.5.  Assuming that winning (or losing) against the friend’s two darts are two independent events.


3.6
 
Part (a)
- Using P(A|B) = P(A, B) / P(B) without any mention of Bayes' rule did not get any credit
- At most half credit for leaving the expression in terms of events and not calculating the probabilities
- Half credit for correct setup of probabilities, but common mistakes of calculating probabilities include:
  - Choosing WITH replacement instead of without

3.7

Part (a)
- Full credit answers: E(Y|X)=(n−X)/(m−1) or E(Y|X=k)=(n−k)/(m−1)
- I also gave 1.5 points for E(Y|X)=(n−X)/m
- The partial credit rubric item for 0.5 points was awarded for an expression equivalent to the following: E(Y|X=x)=∑yyPr(Y=y|X=x).
- 1 point was taken off for writing E(Y|X) as a function of E(X) instead of as a function of X
- Common mistake: X and Y are not independent.

Part (b)
- Full credit answers: Answers equivalent to (n−X)/(m−1)
- I also gave full credit to answer which stated that L(Y|X)=E(Y|X) since E(Y|X) is linear, only if your answer to part (a) was a linear function of X (if it was not immediately clear that your expression E(Y|X) was a linear function of X, then these points were not awarded)
- The partial credit rubric item for 0.5 points was awarded for an expression equivalent to the following: L(Y|X)=E(Y)+[Cov(X,Y)/Var(X)](X−E(X))
- The partial credit rubric item for 1.5 points was awarded very rarely, mainly to students who correctly calculated Cov(X,Y)=−n/m2 (computing E(X) and E(Y) are not sufficient)

Part (c)
- Full credit answers: First step equations, β(i)=1+(1−i/m)β(i+1), where β(i) represents the expected number of balls to throw with i filled bins
- The partial credit rubric item was awarded for recognizing that the states in the Markov chain should be the number of filled bins
- Common mistakes: A Markov chain where the states represent each individual bin, or a Markov chain with only two states (bin with one ball, bin with two balls), or a Markov chain which only counts two bins total (there are m bins total), or other incorrect Markov chains, forgetting the 1 in the first step equations
 
4.2
 
  4 = undecidable
  5 = undecidable
  6 = decidable
    correct solution = 1 point
    incorrect solution = 0 points
    no partial credit
 
5.3:
 
  2 points = k(n−1k−2)+(n−1k−1)
 
  1 point = k(n−c1k−c2)+(n−c3k−c3)
 
  1 point = very close to (n+k−1k−1)−∑k−1i=2(ki)(n−1k−i)
 
  0 points = everything else
 
5.7
 
  Completely unambigious that the answer was 2 ==> 2 points.
 
  Unambigious answer that was not 2 ==> 0 points.
 
  Not clear what the answer was ==> 0 points.
 
6.1
 
Mostly people got this right.
 
Some confusion on contrapostive, but mostly fine.
 
6.2
 
Thought one could reconstruct two variable polynomial f(x,y). Need to observe that the diagonal has x=y, to do this. Some people thought the second set of points gives info about P(x) instead of Q(x).
 
6.3:
 
-> Coloring vertices instead of triples.
-> 3d-1+1 is not 3d-2.
-> Assuming there are 3 triples, or d triples, or 3d triples.
-> color of triple if something mod( number ), and no explanation why that would work.
 
6.4:
 
  ## Error A
    Correct Split :: ∑iai10i=∑iai+∑iai(10i−1)
    In Correct Split :: ∑iai10i=∑iai+∑iai(9∗10...+−...)
 
  ## Error B:
 
    Only proved one of the two directions ==> only 3 out of 4 point.
 
  ## Error C:
 
    We can't assume that multiples of 3 have prefixes / suffices that are multiples of 3.
    For example, 12 is a multiple of 3, but neither 1 nor 2 is a multiple of 3.
    This creates problems with induction.

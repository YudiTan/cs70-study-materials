# Berkeley Spring 2016 CS70 Study Materials

Notes on Berkeley CS70 Spring 2016 Lectures and a few extra final study resources.

Contains:
* Latex notes for every lecture from 10-27
* Comprehensive Notes and Study Guides by TAs Alvin and Sinho
* All HKN Tests from CS70 in the past with solutions
* Partial Cheat Sheet you can add to (I have written ones that I can type up by request)

`/Final/Compilations/notes_lec10_27.pdf` are my compiled notes for all the lectures from 10-27 during the semester. There may be a few errors, but if you add an issue I can fix them up or add the latex files for you to do so on your own.

Checkout `AlvinWanNotes.pdf` and `SinhoNotes.pdf` for comprehensive and helpful guides to success in this class. Happy studying!

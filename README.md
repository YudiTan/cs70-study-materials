# Berkeley Spring 2016 CS70 Study Materials

Notes on Berkeley CS70 Spring 2016 Lectures and a few extra final study resources. I haven't added the latex files, so you can't really edit anything, but just add an issue if you want these files.

`/Final/Compilations/notes_lec10_27.pdf` are my compiled notes for all the lectures from 10-27 during the semester. There may be a few errors, but if you add an issue I can fix them up or add the latex files for you to do so on your own.

Checkout `AlvinWanNotes.pdf` and `SinhoNotes.pdf` for comprehensive and helpful guides to success in this class. Happy studying!

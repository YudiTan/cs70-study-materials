# Berkeley Spring 2016 CS70 Study Materials

Notes on Berkeley CS70 Spring 2016 Lectures and a few extra final study resources.

Contains:
* Latex notes for every lecture from 10-27
* Comprehensive Notes and Study Guides by TAs Alvin and Sinho
* All HKN Tests from CS70 in the past with solutions
* Partial Cheat Sheet you can add to (I have written ones that I can type up by request)

`/Final/Compilations/notes_lec10_27.pdf` are my compiled notes for all the lectures from 10-27 during the semester. There may be a few errors, but if you add an issue I can fix them up or add the latex files for you to do so on your own.

Checkout `AlvinWanNotes.pdf` and `SinhoNotes.pdf` for comprehensive and helpful guides to success in this class. Happy studying!

*Note: Minor errors may exist. Feel free to make any edits to the .tex files, but make sure to recompile and add the edited pdf to BOTH the correct lecture folder and the compiled document `/Final/Compilations/notes_lec10_27.pdf`*
